# Workflow

On a terminal write

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Belonias/pyStudyGroupSlack.git .
```

*Windows users update coming soon*

Then you create a folder with your slack name

```
$ mkdir iakovos.belonias
```
Then you enter the folder you just created

```
$ cd iakovos.belonias
```

And there you can do what ever you want
For this example I will create a README.md file
saying some things about me

```
$ vim README.md
```

I can create a folder with my projects
**OR**
Ask for help from other members

# 
Then you add the folder on git

```
$ git add iakovos.belonias
```

Then you commit and as a commit message you write your slack name

```
$ git commit -m "iakovos.belonias"
```

And you push the commit

```
$ git push
```

That's all folks
