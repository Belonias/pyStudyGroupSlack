# Daniel Quinn

I've been writing Python since 2008 and specialise in web stuff, primarily
Django.  I'm in the channel most of the time, but don't read every message.
If you have a question that you think I can help with, feel free to mention
me in the channel or just DM me.

Here's all of my stuffs:

* [Github](https://github.com/danielquinn)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/searchingfortao)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielquinn)
* [Website](http://danielquinn.org/)

## Some Python-specific projects

My github profile is full of Python stuff, but if you're new to the language,
you may find my [presentation & workshop for PHP nerds](https://github.com/danielquinn/Python-Django-for-PHP-Nerds)
wanting to do Python to be of interest.

If you're reasonably familiar with Python, my most successful proejct is [Paperless](https://github.com/danielquinn/paperless),
with [Korra](https://github.com/danielquinn/korra) as a distant second.
